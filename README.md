Hi, I’m Petri Pihla.

I’m currently working as a software _(firmware)_ developper at **Danfoss** Vaasa. I'm also doing my bachelor's thesis for Danfoss. I hope to have my degree from **VAMK** done next summer (2023).

I have mainly focused on `C` and `STM32`. But I have also stumbled upon some light web development and some `SQL` stuff. Windows is my go to OS because of music production, but I'm allso familliar with `Linux` environments. 

Well at least I can spawn my own servers in `Googles/AWS cloud` and do some light webscraping with `Python`.

I have worked with `Azures` `GIT` stuff and have surface level understanding on `CI` pipelines.

TODO: learn to write maby :)
